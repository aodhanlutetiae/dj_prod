## About Producing journalism with data

These pages have been prepared at Jomec, Cardiff University's school of journalism, as part of online data training for BBC journalists. They are now available for anyone to use and there is a [github repository](https://github.com/aodhanlutetiae/dj_prod) available for download. They follow an earlier module [Getting started with data for journalism](https://aodhanlutetiae.github.io/dj/).
